### Section Header


**Subheader** 

This is the body copy. If you want to make something bold, use **this** format. If you want italics, try *this*. 

**Subheader**

If you would like to include a link, try [something like this](http://example.com/ "Title"), or you don't need the title attribute at all if you don't want: [an example](http://example.com/)

**Text boxes**

Perhaps you would like a list! Here's one!

* List Item One
* Number Two
* Number Three


1. Numbered list 1
2. Numbered list 2


Of course everyone likes images. I use inline html for this so I can keep containers and CSS classes. There are a few CSS classes you can use depending on how wide of an image you want. The classes are: "third-width", "half-width", and "two-thirds-width". At the moment all images will stack vertically, not horizontally.

            
<div class='image-container'>
	<img class="two-thirds-width" src="https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/311511/screenshots/1946687/marsone.gif" />
</div>
