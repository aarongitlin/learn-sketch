        **Subheader** 

        This is the body copy. If you want to make something bold, use **this** format. If you want italics, try *this*. 

        **Subheader**

        If you would like to include a link, try [something like this](http://example.com/ "Title"), or you don't need the title attribute at all if you don't want: [an example](http://example.com/)

        **Text boxes**

        Perhaps you would like a list! Here's one!

        * List Item One
        * Number Two
        * Number Three

        Of course everyone likes images. I use inline html for this so I can keep containers and CSS classes. There are a few CSS classes you can use depending on how wide of an image you want. The classes are: "third-width", "half-width", and "two-thirds-width". At the moment all images will stack vertically, not horizontally.

                    
        <div class='image-container'>
          <img class="two-thirds-width" src="images/create_symbol.png" />
        </div>
